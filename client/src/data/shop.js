Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.                                    For chimichurri sauce:                                        Combine first 8 ingredients in blender; blend until almost smooth. Add 1/4 of parsley, 1/4 of cilantro, and 1/4 of mint; blend until incorporated. Add remaining herbs in 3 more additions, pureeing until almost smooth after each addition.                                                                            Do ahead: Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.                                    For beef tenderloin:                                        Let beef stand at room temperature 1 hour.                                                                            Prepare barbecue (high heat). Pat beef dry with paper towels; brush with oil. Sprinkle all over with spice rub, using all of mixture (coating will be thick). Place beef on grill; sear 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium-high. Grill uncovered until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of beef registers 130F for medium-rare, moving beef to cooler part of grill as needed to prevent burning, and turning occasionally, about 40 minutes. Transfer to platter; cover loosely with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice beef crosswise. Serve with chimichurri sauce.                                                                            *Available at specialty foods stores and from tienda.com."

Grill over medium-high heat until soft and nicely browned, about 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside under foil. Brush the onion slices with the oil and season with salt. Grill over medium-high heat until charred and soft, about 3 minutes. Set aside under foil.Grill the burger buns until toasty, about 2 minutes. When ready to serve, return the mushrooms to the grill over medium-low heat and top with the cheese slices. Cover with the hood so the cheese can melt. Alternatively, if cooking indoors, place the mushrooms on a baking sheet and melt cheese under the broiler for 1 minutes. Assemble the burgers: Slather the romesco sauce on both buns, top the bottom half with the mushroom cap, followed by the arugula. Sandwich together and serve with the remaining sauce on the side.",
